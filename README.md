# A Loose Confederation

> I think the way forward here is to make what I suspect is a loose confederation of folks using non-compete licenses to actually get together and draft their own set of values. To then brand that. And stand behind it proudly.

> We value software freedom for users to an extent, but we don’t think of it in the same strident terms as the Free Software movement. We think of freedom primarily in terms of **access** to technology and knowledge to improve efficiency for developers. What’s more, it’s not the only thing that matters to us. We also value **sustainability** for developers. The two are often in tension. Finding and maintaining a good balance between them is what Open Source means to us.

## First, a New License

We're focused on [writing a new license](https://github.com/getsentry/loose-confederation/issues/4) (evolution of the BSL), which we want to [announce on November 17](https://github.com/getsentry/loose-confederation/issues/7). Jump in!

## Then, a New Brand?

Beyond the new license, we're [brainstorming what a new brand might be](https://github.com/getsentry/loose-confederation/issues/2).
