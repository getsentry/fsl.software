          <p>
            The Functional Source License (FSL) is a mostly permissive
            non-compete license that converts to Apache 2.0 or MIT after two
            years. It is designed for SaaS companies that value both user
            freedom and developer sustainability. FSL provides everything a
            developer needs to use and learn from your software without

          <dl>
            <dt>Why?</dt>

            <dd>
              Many SaaS companies wish to make the source code for their core
              products available under
              <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permissive_software_license"
                >permissive</a
              >
              terms without the risk of
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free-rider_problem"
                >harmful free-riding</a
              >. A standard license for this purpose makes life easier for both
              producers and consumers of such software.
            </dd>

            <dt>What is harmful free-riding?</dt>

            <dd>
              Harmful free-riding is the sort of free-riding that leads to
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free-rider_problem"
                >the free-rider problem</a
              >: “In the social sciences, the free-rider problem is a type of
              market failure that occurs when those who benefit from resources,
              public goods and common pool resources do not pay for them or
              under-pay. Examples of such goods are public roads or public
              libraries or services or other goods of a communal nature. Free
              riders are a problem for common pool resources because they may
              overuse it by not paying for the good (either directly through
              fees or tolls or indirectly through taxes). Consequently, the
              common pool resource may be under-produced, overused, or degraded.
              Additionally, it has been shown that despite evidence that people
              tend to be cooperative by nature (a prosocial behaviour), the
              presence of free-riders causes cooperation to deteriorate,
              perpetuating the free-rider problem.”
            </dd>

            <dt>Why not Open Source?</dt>
            <dd>
              <a href="https://opensource.org/osd/">Open Source</a> does not
              protect against harmful free-riding.
            </dd>

            <dt>What about AGPLv3 though?</dt>
            <dd>
              <a href="https://opensource.org/license/agpl-v3/">AGPLv3</a>
              is not permissive enough. As a highly viral copyleft license, it
              exposes users to serious licensing risk. FSL does not place any
              conditions on users beyond simple attribution, so FSL software can
              be adopted at organizations where AGPL is outside of policy.
            </dd>

            <dt>Why not open core?</dt>
            <dd>
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-core_model"
                >Open core</a
              >
              is not permissive enough. It restricts based on feature set, such
              that some product features are <i>never</i> open. Moreover, the
              percentage of features that are restricted is highly variable from
              product to product. With FSL, all product features are available
              now for almost all uses, and are soon fully permissive.
            </dd>

            <dt>Why not [some other alternative]?</dt>

            <dd>
              There have been many somewhat similar attempts over the decades to
              balance user freedom and developer sustainability. None has truly
              caught on in the industry, and their original sponsors have either
              stopped promoting or outright abandoned them.

              <br /><br />

              FSL's immediate predecessor is the
              <a href="https://mariadb.com/bsl11/">Business Source License</a>
              (BSL or BUSL). BSL's time-based approach is great, but the
              Additional Use Grant is a serious flaw, because it creates
              <a
                href="https://web.archive.org/web/20231106144534/https://blog.adamretter.org.uk/business-source-license-adoption/#how-is-the-bsl-being-used"
                >too much variability</a
              >. Each BSL implementation is essentially a new license. Also,
              four years is too long. FSL is an evolved BSL that (we hope) has a
              better chance of catching on.

            <dt>What can I do with FSL software?</dt>

            <dd>
              You can do anything with FSL software except undermine its
              producer. You can run it for almost all purposes, study it, modify
              it, and distribute your changes, including proposing improvements
              back to the producer. After two years it becomes permissive Open
              Source software under Apache 2.0 or MIT.
            </dd>

            <dt>Why only Apache 2.0 and MIT?</dt>

            <dd>
              Looking at popular licenses according to
              <a

                >OSI</a
              >
              and <a href="https://choosealicense.com/">GitHub</a>: copyleft is
              not our jam, and BSD/ISC don't offer anything over MIT. That
              leaves Apache 2.0 (with its patent grant) and MIT.
            </dd>

            <dt>What's with the name?</dt>
            <dd>Meh, it's functional. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯</dd>
